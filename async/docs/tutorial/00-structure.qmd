title: Structure of files
---

The rust files in the `ratatui-template` project are organized as follows:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── build.rs
└── src
   ├── app.rs
   ├── components
   │  ├── home.rs
   │  ├── logger.rs
   │  └── mod.rs
   ├── lib.rs
   ├── main.rs
   ├── event.rs
   ├── terminal.rs
   └── utils.rs
```

Once you have setup the project initially, you shouldn't need to change the contents of anything outside of the `components` folder.

Let's discuss the contents of the files outside of the `components` folder first in the following sections.
