### When should I use `tokio` or `async`/`await`?

`ratatui` isn't a native `async` library.
So is it beneficial to use `tokio` or `async`/`await`?

And as a user, there's really only 1 point of interface with `ratatui` and that's the `terminal.draw(|f| ui(f))` functionality (rendering of widgets happens in `ui(f)`).
Everything else in your code is your own to do as you wish.

Should `terminal.draw(|f| ui(f))` be `async`?
Possibly.
Rendering to the terminal buffer is relatively fast, especially using the double buffer technique that only renders diffs that `ratatui` uses.

Can we make it `async` ourselves?
Yes, we can.
That's covered in the material in this documentation.

The only other part related to `ratatui` that is beneficial to being `async` is reading the key event inputs from `stdin`, and that can be made `async` with `crossterm`'s event-stream.

So the real question (in my mind usually) is what other parts of your app require `async` or benefit from being `async`?
If the answer is not much, maybe it is simpler to not use `async` and avoiding `tokio`.

Another canary would be, do you think your app would work better with 1 thread like this?

```svgbob
 ,-------------.
 |Get Key Event|
 `-----+-------'
       |
       |
 ,-----v------.
 |Update State|
 `-----+------'
       |
       |
   ,---v----.
   | Render |
   `--------'
```

Or would it work with 3 threads / `tokio` tasks like this:

```svgbob
    Render Thread       ┊         Event Thread             ┊     Main Thread
                        ┊                                  ┊
                        ┊      ,------------------.        ┊
                        ┊      |  Get Key Event   |        ┊
                        ┊      `--------+---------'        ┊
                        ┊               |                  ┊
                        ┊     ,---------v-----------.      ┊
                        ┊     | Map Event to Action |      ┊
                        ┊     `---------+-----------'      ┊
                        ┊               |                  ┊
                        ┊  ,------------V--------------.   ┊     ,-------------.
                        ┊  | Send Action on action_tx  |---┊---->| Recv Action |
                        ┊  `---------------------------´   ┊     `-----+-------´
                        ┊                                  ┊           |
,-------------------.   ┊                                  ┊  ,--------v--------.
| Recv on render_rx |<--┊----------------------------------┊--| Dispatch Action |
`--------+----------´   ┊                                  ┊  `--------+--------´
         |              ┊                                  ┊           |
,--------v---------.    ┊                                  ┊  ,--------v---------.
| Render Component |    ┊                                  ┊  |   Update State   |
`------------------´    ┊                                  ┊  `------------------´
```

The former be without `async` and the latter is the approach described in this documentation with `tokio`.
