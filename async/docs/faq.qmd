# When should I use `tokio` or `async`/`await`?

`ratatui` isn't a native `async` library.
As a user, there's really only 1 point of interface with `ratatui` and that's the `terminal.draw(|f| ui(f))` functionality (rendering of widgets happens in `ui(f)`).
Everything else in your code is your own to do as you wish.

Should `terminal.draw(|f| ui(f))` be `async`?
Possibly.
Rendering to the terminal buffer is relatively fast, especially using the double buffer technique that only renders diffs.

Can we make it `async` ourselves?
Yes, we can.
That's covered in the material in this documentation.

The only other part related to `ratatui` that is beneficial to be `async` is reading the key event inputs from `stdin`, and that can be made `async` with `crossterm`'s event stream.

So the real question (in my mind usually) is what other apps of your app require `async` or benefit from being `async`?
If the answer is not much, maybe it is simpler to not use `async` and avoiding `tokio`.
